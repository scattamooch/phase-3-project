# TBDnD

Create your very own character for Dungeons and Dragons and then send them to battle!

## Description

A CLI application where the user can create a DnD character. Allows the user to find out more information about the races and classes in DnD before selecting their desired race and class. User can then "roll the dice" for their 6 skill categories and assign those values in order to finish creating their character.

User can then see all the available characters and their corresponding stats. Choose a fighter and enter the battle arena to be placed with a random opponent to battle against. Users can then fight another character using a range of attacks and healing options until their is a sole victor.

Do you think you have what it takes?
